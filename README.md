## About this
For an interview i was face to do this in order to prove the skill to manage, maintain and improve the skillset for a project.  

I decide to use `jest` for generate the test cases needed for this requirements. improving the time of resolving the cases, i use node and git in the process to send the results.

## How to Install
use `npm install`  to install the require node modules for this project.

## Usage
use `node fizzbuzz` to run the app and print the results of numbers from 1 to 20.

use `npm test` for run a single circle of tests and print the results.

use `npm test:watch` for run the test cases in a loop, for watch changes to the code.
